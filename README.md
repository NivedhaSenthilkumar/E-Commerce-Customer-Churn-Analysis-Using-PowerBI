Process
1.	Data Import and Cleaning: The data is imported into Power BI and undergoes initial transformations and cleaning using Power Query to ensure data quality and consistency.
2.	Data Modeling: The cleaned data is modeled to create relationships between different variables and prepare it for analysis.
3.	Measures Creation with DAX: Key performance indicators (KPIs) and measures are created using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to quantify customer churn and other relevant metrics.
